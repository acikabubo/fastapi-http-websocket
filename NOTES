AsyncAttrs in SQLAlchemy is a mixin class designed to facilitate asynchronous access to
related objects (relationships) within SQLAlchemy ORM models when working with an
asynchronous database driver and an asynchronous engine (e.g., created with
create_async_engine).

When an ORM model incorporates AsyncAttrs, its relationships become "awaitable." This
means that when you access a related object that is lazily loaded, you must await the
access to fetch the data from the database asynchronously. This prevents blocking the
event loop in an asynchronous application.
