- Graceful Disconnect Handling
  Ensure WebSocket handlers always clean up connections:
    try:
      ...
    except WebSocketDisconnect:
      manager.disconnect(ws)

- Rate Limiting for WebSockets
  The repo already mentions Redis-based rate limiting. That’s excellent — but make sure it’s applied:
    on connection attempts
    on incoming message rates
    with clear policy defaults and configurable parameters.
  Rate limiting should be efficient and avoid false positives under load.
